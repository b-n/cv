Welcome, Goedendag!

I'm an architect, senior developer, consultant, cloud systems enthusiast, and a
transformer of ideas into software. My current focus is working on the
Salesforce.com platform, where I fill the role of a Solutions Architect
Consultant.

### My usual day

- Delivering software for many companies across many different industries by
  writing efficient, standards-based, high-performing code that fulfills the
  business requirements
- Discovering what the client needs for their project by challenging the status
  quo and then providing true business value
- Providing high-level architectural guidance for complex integration points
  across many different clients
- Engaging with our wider team, bringing a sense of camaraderie to the office
- Working in small agile teams, flexibly and effectively delivering great
  outcomes

### Whilst not at work

- Learning Dutch
- Web/mobile app development
- Playing with ICs, Arduinoâ€™s, Photons (particle.io)
- Woodworking
- Being outdoors, hiking overnight trips in the middle of nowhere
- Playing board games with friends (all the good ones of course)"
