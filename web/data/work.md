Most of my daytime Salesforce related work is done for clients, and therefore I
can't publish any real projects. However, the following are some of the
frameworks that I have regularly contributed to and/or developed:

- [Bitbucket SFDX + ANT pipeline container](https://github.com/nzchicken/pipeline-dx)
- [clean-salesforce (WIP)](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/clean-salesforce)
- [Salesforce-Test-Factory](https://www.github.com/dhoechst/Salesforce-Test-Factory)
- [CalloutMock](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/CalloutMock)
- [Salesforce-Lightning-Flux](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/Salesforce-Lightning-Flux)

These are some of the frameworks that I regularly use:

- [sfdc-trigger-framework](https://www.github.com/kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework)
- [declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries](https://www.github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries)
- [fflib-apex-common](https://www.github.com/financialforcedev/fflib-apex-common)

And for all my side projects (React, NodeJS, Serverless, etc), check out my
