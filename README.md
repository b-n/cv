# CV - All things about me, and more!

## Introduction

This site uses Gatsby. Why? Because it was fun to play with it, it does lots of 
optimizations for prefetching which I don't have a great interest in learning 
right now, and it Just Works:tm:

## Tooling

To develop:

    npm run start

To build (output stored in ./public)

    npm run build

To publish (currently publishes to GH Pages)

    npm run publish

And if you see something wrong, PR me, I'll be more than happy to accept
