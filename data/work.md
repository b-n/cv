You've manage to make it this far, thank you! I wanted to on touch how I work.

The things that make me most productive:
- Having a good product owner
- Using ViM for all my coding things
- Writing tests for all the things
- Being able to be open and honest with my team members
- Using good coding principles such as Clean Code, Domain Driven Design, and 
  SOLID
- Being in an environment where I'm able to learn new things and able to throw a 
  joke here and there

I am a supporter of Open Source Software, and try to contribute where I can. 
I've pushed OSS iniatives at my work places, to ensure we're giving back. 
Unfortunately I'm not allowed to share a large amount of my daily work, as it's 
protected IP, however these are some things I've tried to give back:
- [Bitbucket SFDX + ANT pipeline container](https://github.com/nzchicken/pipeline-dx)
- [clean-salesforce (WIP)](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/clean-salesforce)
- [Salesforce-Test-Factory](https://www.github.com/dhoechst/Salesforce-Test-Factory)
- [CalloutMock](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/CalloutMock)
- [Salesforce-Lightning-Flux](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/Salesforce-Lightning-Flux)

The above list isn't always up to date, so feel free to check my 
[Github](https://www.github.com/nzchicken) for more information.

When developing on Salesforce, these are the things I generally fall back on to 
speed up my development time:
- [sfdc-trigger-framework](https://www.github.com/kevinohara80/sfdc-trigger-framework)
- [declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries](https://www.github.com/afawcett/declarative-lookup-rollup-summaries)
- [fflib-apex-common](https://www.github.com/financialforcedev/fflib-apex-common)

This site was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/), not because it 
needed to be, but because it looked like fun to play with. Some of my other more 
"Showcase projects are here":
- [Sensors](https://nzchicken.github.io/sensors) - A set of sensors in my office 
  that measure how hard it is to work there based on Air Conditions
- [Tasker](https://nzchicken.github.io/tasker) - A set of buttons on my desk 
  which I can use to measure what I'm working on, and when
- [This Site](https://www.github.com/nzchicken/cv) - You know, because you 
  wanted to see the source code anyway right?
