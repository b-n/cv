ðŸ¤žThe above gave most of the answers. If you're here, it's just for the fun.

Here's some things that make me most productive:

- Having a peer at the same technical level as me (I need some technical
  challenges).
- Having a team that is proactively engaging and looking for things to do.
- Delivering value regularly (at least every couple of days).
- Having good developer tooling - or at least letting me fix this for everyone.
- Having an open team environment, we are here to solve problems.
- Flat heirarchy - we're all flesh and bones.

Also, in my free time I like to contribute back in the OSS space. My main focus
is towards [Artichoke](https://www.artichokeruby.org/) - Building a Ruby
interpreter in Rust ðŸ¦€.

Any present projects I'm working on can generally be found on my
[Github](https://github.com/b-n). I'm probably playing with something
simulation and/or data related.

And here's some presentations/talks I've done in recent times:
- [Async Ruby](https://b-n.github.io/async-ruby) - August 2022
- [What the WASM](https://b-n.github.io/what-the-wasm) - July 2022

This site was built using [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and is hosted
on Github Pages.
