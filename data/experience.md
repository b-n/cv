The main technologies that I use daily (since 2020) include (but aren't
limited to): Ruby, Ruby on Rails, GoLang, Kubernetes, Docker/Containers,
Tilt, Nginx, GCP... and likely more.

My contributions to the open source realm are largely in Rust as those projects
generally are targeting speed and memory optimizations.

I feel at home in both Typed and Untyped code bases - prefering typed if and
when available.

Prior to 2020, I was writing code and developing on the Salesforce.com
ecosystem for the better part of 8 years - 6 of which as a full time software
engineer. I moved on from Salesforce development due to the strict structure
enforced by working in that ecosystem, wanting to use more modern and exciting
technologies. The main other technologies I was investing in at that time was
Serverless Architecture, specifically AWS provided.

Apart form the usual soft skills, I regularly:

- Organise company internal tech talks, tech blogs etc
- Present technical talks internally to the company
- Present technical talks external to the company - e.g. meetups, mostly in Rust
- Find ways to generate developer events such as Hackathons, etc
- Activley promote and encourage remote/hybrid communication - mainly through
  the means of [new] slack channels, organising and engaging with others in
  social events, and always hopping on calls to pair with people to solve issues
