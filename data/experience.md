The main technologies that I use daily (since 2020) include (but aren't
limited to): Ruby, Ruby on Rails, GoLang, Kubernetes, Docker, Dockerised
app development, Tilt, Nginx, GCP, etc.

My contributions to the open source realm are largely in Rust as those projects
generally are targeting speed and memory optimizations.

I feel at home in both Typed and Untyped code bases - prefering typed if and
when available.

Prior to 2020, I was writing code and developing on the Salesforce.com
ecosystem for the better part of 8 years - 6 of which as a full time software
engineer. I moved on from Salesforce development due to the strict structure
enforced by working in that ecosystem, wanting to use more modern and exciting
technologies. The main other technologies I was investing in at that time was
Serverless Architecture, specifically AWS provided.

Apart form the usual soft skills, I regularly:

- Organise company internal tech talks, tech blogs etc.
- Present technical talks internally to the company
- Present at meetups (more Rust than Ruby)
- Find ways to generate developer events such as Hackathons, etc
- Actively post and engage with teams on Slack, creating OT channels to the
  likes of #dotfiles, #side\_projects, #new\_emojis, #vacay\_vibes, anything
  where there might be shared interests for people (and myself) to engage in.
