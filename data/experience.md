My exposure has been largely to Salesforce related technologies since 2011, 
however in my spare time I focus largely on newer web technologies. I focus on
the best technology for the task at hand, however I tend to come back to 
React for my frontends, and I generally focus on Serverless and Microservice 
Architectures (implemented through AWS, GCP, Openwhisk) for my back ends.

I prefer writing business logic rather than presentational layers, however in
saying that, I am at home writing both Frontend and Backend code. I'm proficient
in Javascript (ES6, ES.Next), however I have an interest in Python, Go, and C++ 
too.

As for Salesforce technologies, I'm at home using Lightning, Visualforce, Apex, 
SFDX, Packaging, and any other technologies Salesforce chooses to implement. 
Generally speaking, I write a lot more Apex than anything else, but that is 
largely due to the user stories I have been recently building.

I've also done a number of talks and presentations on a wide variety of topics 
from Salesforce, Serverless, Women in Tech, to groups of people from 30 to 350.
