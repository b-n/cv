Fronde is a leading Digital Consulting firm inside New Zealand where I fulfiled 
the role of Senior Technical Consultant - specfiically working with Salesforce 
technologies.

My highlights at Fronde were:
- Taking complex requirements and business processes, filtering them down to 
  business needs, and implementing quality solutions
- Working in a variety of industries, and apply general common sense problem 
  solving to complex work activities.
- Experimenting with IoT technologies, integrating Salesforce Data with a 
  Physical Brass Bell, ringing when people closed opportunities
- Speaking at Dreamforce 2015 to a room of 350 people on a complex Salesforce 
  technical topic of Dynamic Apex Binding
