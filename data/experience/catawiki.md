Some of the core business orientated highlights:

- From ideation to implementation, arranged and organised a group of developers
  and platform engineers to migrate from legacy container images to new image
  structure and format. Reduced custom designs to industry best practices, and 
  derisked a 3 year old security concern
- Migrated 17 ccTLDs to a singular locale aware domain, for 30+ microservices in
  a 3 phase roll out for a 10 year old application without downtime
- Designed and implemented changes to an automation which resulted in ~2 million
  euro a year worth of cost savings
- Produced, organised and promoted many new artefact and their structures
  (documentation, automations, etc) in a landscape where such artefacts were not
  commonplace
- Spotted the need -> Organised and developed Kubernetes Base training to
  bring developer skills up to a base standard for the company

I also like to create a positive developer culture, so there's a bunch of these:

- Formed groups of ICs to brainstorm and develop the next generation of
  Developer Experience for the company
- Contributed, evolved and actively promoted Internal Tech Talks, External Tech
  Blog, and an Internal Tech Unconference
- Created a fireside chat format with all of CXX and Extended management when
  the company shifted to remote working to bring out the human side of
  management
