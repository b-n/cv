Localist utilised heavy Salesforce customization (Custom Objects, Visualforce, Apex, etc) to provide an automated solution of Sales to Print of their local business guide.

I was one of the two direct employees working on the Salesforce.com instance, where we were accountable for data fixes, user administration, and development of the system. Due to the extensive customisation, and long deployment times, many improvements were made to existing customisation and configuration elements. Regular data audits and cleanups were performed to ensure financial data was not affected. Reports and Dashboards were utilised heavily to provide proactive monitoring of any data issues.
