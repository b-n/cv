I originally started working with Guidion whilst I was consulting at Nextview
around March '17.

Largest achievements:

- Building a Financial integration that reliably processes 10s of 
  Millions of Euros per year.
- Recognised by Salesforce Corporate Product team as a champion of their SFDX
  and Packaging 2 changes (Bleeding edge).
- Professionalised the Salesforce development industry by generating and
  maintaining general use libraries and utilities

Environment:

- Agile software development using Scrum. 2 week sprints. ~15 Software Engineers.
- ~800 userbase dealing with complex app business logic. Specifically materials
  and product dependencies, completion gates, complex validations etc.
- 10-20 million worth of revenue being generated through the code I wrote, thus
  reliablility and traceability were key.
- Most senior dev on staff. Accountable for overall software, system, and object
  architecture, however preferred to delegate and rotate responsibility to 
  ensure everyone was engaged
