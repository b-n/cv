I originally started working with Guidion whilst I was consulting at Nextview
around March '17.

Largest achievements:

- Led the technical implementation of a migration from a 10 yr old system to a
  new platform.
- Built a reliable Financial Integration that in one year processed €30+
  million through 900,000+ transactions.
- Created and implemented developer tools in a platform where it wasn’t common,
  including: Semver, linting, test automation, etc. Was recognised by the host
  platform provider.
- Succeeded in using bleeding edge technology, whilst contributing back to the
  community, encouraging other developers to move towards modern technology
  and modern toolsets.

Environment:

- Created and set a standard for tight team and business collaboration through
  clear presentations in understandable terms for all parties.
- Setup a documentation standard for consistent System documentation.
- ~800 userbase dealing with complex app business logic. Specifically materials
  and product dependencies, completion gates, complex validations etc.
- Most senior dev on staff. Accountable for overall software, system, and object
  architecture, however preferred to delegate and rotate responsibility to 
  ensure everyone was engaged.
