I originally started working with Guidion whilst I was consulting at Nextview
around March '17.

My largest achievements at Guidon so far:
- Building a Financial integration that reliably works to process 10s of 
  Millions of Euros per year
- Championing SFDX and Packaging 2, gaining recognition from Salesforce Product 
  Lines and influencing features for everyone
- Building packagable components and generic utilies in soon to be released 
  public repositories

At Guidion, we work in a very structured Scrum and Agile environment of 2 weeks, 
where we constantly and consistently deliver quality features and improvements. 
I have spent a large amount of time investing and helping our teams to develop 
out our Agile and team strategies. In addition to this, I have owned large parts 
of the system architecture, collaborating with the team to ensure our standards 
are solid, and owned by everyone.
