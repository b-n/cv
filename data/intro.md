Welkom!

I'm Ben, it's nice to meet you!

I'm a software developer at heart, and I just so happen to do this during the 
day at work. I like to add something back to the world by making enterprise
grade software that stops people from having to do monotonous jobs, freeing them
up to do more important things.

I work largely with web technologies, but also play a bit with Integrated
Circuits and the Internet of Things. I've been developing on Salesforce since
2011, of which 4 years were in consultancies where I had exposure to a wide 
variety of industries.

I am:
- A New Zealander
- Trying to become Dutch
- A lover of all things Serverless
- A Software/Solutions architect
- Constantly looking for new things to learn
- An all round pragmatist
- A person that works well in teams, and enjoys Agile software development

This website serves to give you some more information about what I do, what I've 
done, and where I want to go to.
