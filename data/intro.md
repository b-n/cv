Hoi 👋! I'm Ben!

Software Engineer and Dev ex enthusiast by day, Rustacean 🦀 hacker by night.

I like writing code, but I like optimizing developer work flows even more. I
have a firm belief that a productive engineer has the right tools for the job,
and those tools should help them to do the things they are paid to do. I also
happen to enjoy giving back to the open source realm.

I've worked on code bases of varying sizes and complexities, in the breadth of
intertwined complex business logic with many compounding state machines, all
the way to highly available micro services handling in the realms of 1000req/s.
I always come back to finding ways to optimize work flows, and bringing
engineers together in fun, new and creative ways to solve ~problems~ challenges.

I am:
- Born in New Zealand 🇳🇿
- An EU permanent resident in The Netherlands 🇳🇱
- Open source enthusiast 🦄
- Knowledge and technology sponge 🧽
- A pragmatist at heart 💝
- Active team member, needing a collaborative environment to be the most effective 💹
